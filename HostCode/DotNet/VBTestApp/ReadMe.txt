This project is for convenience testing the Visual Basic DLL framework.

It is not intended for distribution.

In order to use, copy PMDLibrary.vb from the VisualBasic directory to here, and copy
a built version of HostCode\Debug\C-Motion.dll to VBTestApp\bin\Debug, then open the
PMDTestApp.vbproj file, build, and run.
