The Hello project is an almost minimal example of a C-Motion Engine program.

The program will print some information to the console:

   * A "Hello, world" message.
   * The program version, which is 1.0 as provided.
   * The encoder reading for axis 1, which will be set to 1000.

After the initial prints, the program will enter a loop that polls the
encoder position every second, and prints the time in milliseconds and
the encoder position whenever the position changes.
